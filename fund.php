    <b>Anjuman-I-Islam’s A.R. Kalsekar Polytechnic (ARKP)</b>, established in the year <b>2002-2003</b> managed by the prestigious Anjuman-I-Islam trust Mumbai.

    <h2>Why ARKP needs your support</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Sustaining high quality of education and research</b> -- with a major impact on the society at large -- is pivotal in the growth of an academic institution. Good infrastructural support (buildings, equipment, networks, etc,) and high quality human resources (faculty, staff, etc.) are critical to a quality institution. ARKP, Panvel is a unique institution in its structure. It is autonomous; with the latitude to quickly decide and act on its own, which is priceless. However, as an autonomous institution, we are expected to generate our own operational revenues and funds to build our infrastructure. Our goal is to scale up from a 1,500 student university today to a 4,000 student university in ten years. This means not just more students, but also research across more domains and hence more impact.  This requires a delicate balance between quality and affordability of education which can be achieved largely through philanthropic gestures from multiple sources, of which alumni can play a key role.

    </p>
    <p>
    The <b>alumni fund was setup</b> as a modality for alumni to have a direct hand in helping the Institute grow. The fund has been used to provide tuition support for meritorious student in financial need. The total money raised from alumni and caution deposit donations is ~ Rs 69 lakhs. So far this <b>scheme has benefited 33 students</b>. Of these, 13 students have already paid back the loans they received. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this round of fund raising, alumni can choose to contribute in the following categories:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Infrastructure</b> - Strong infrastructure (classrooms, labs, hostels, sports facilities, etc) is the hallmark of any good institution which is why it forms an important parameter used in all popular rankings of educational institutions.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Tuition support</b> – This is intended to provide access to meritorious students to an education in ARKP despite having inadequate financial resources.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Institute corpus</b> - This is a perpetual endowment to the institute. The donation to this category will be used to invest and only the interest earned will be used for top priorities of the institute. This ensures that the institute benefits from the donation on a recurring basis, rather than a one-time benefit. Endowments are an effective way to invest in better research, better education and better people without cascading the costs to students. 
    </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Note:</b>
All contributions within India are tax deductible under <b>section 80G</b> and receipts will be sent to the mailing address given by you at the time of contribution.
    </p>
    <p>
    Donors will be give the right to choose a scholarship named as they please provided the donation is sufficient to support the complete studies of a student. We have one such scholarship currently supporting an undergraduate student.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Batchwise contributions</b> can also be made to name different spaces in the Institute.

    <h2>Comments from Loan beneficiaries</h2>
    <ul>

    I was happy when I got admission into ARKP, But my parents worried a lot about fee structure as they had already faced lot of financial issues during my schooling to pay my school fees.  But Fortunately, I did not face any financial problem after I stepped into my Bachelors at ARKP because of Alumni loan. In my entire stay at ARKP, I did not face any situation of worrying about paying fees. It gave me a chance to concentrate fully on my studies and research.  That helped me a lot to be what I am now. I would really like to thank each and everyone who is contributing towards Alumni funds. I look forward to take part in contributing to Alumni fund in future, whenever I can.

    It's really a great helping hand for needy. Personally, I thought of discontinuing my education even after placing into one of the best Indian institutes like ARKP because of financial needs. But with the help of education loan provided by the Alumni, I did manage to continue my studies. I'm very grateful to my Alumni for this great help. I definitely contribute to Alumni Fund from part so that it would help others who are in the same position.

    Alumni has given loan to me during my first semester. I was in full of debts after paying the college fees (as I borrowed money from financier at higher interest). I was left with no choice to clear the debts. ARKP Alumni is the one who has helped me as soon as I asked. Alumni has not only given money but also confidence that they are here to help people like me. I am thankful to the Alumni.
